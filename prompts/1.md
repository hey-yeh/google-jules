# Prompt 1 on Saturday, May 24, 2025 - 3:02 PM:


```
Let's make a game with Phaser.io and Typescript.

All our games will be stored in the games/ folder, which doesn't yet exist. The first game will be game #1, which will be stored in games/1/

Let's start with a simple wrapper for a simple hello world Phaser project:
* games/1/ contains index.html
* games/1/ contains game.ts which is compiled to game.js. For simplicity, let's keep the built JS files alongside the TS files. This is a super simple game.
* index.html
  - Responsive webpage that works for iOS/Android and also desktop web.
  - The phaser game will take up 100% width and 100% height of the page. 
  - The page background is #222222.
* game.ts
  - This game is simple. It presents four shapes on screen in a 2 x 2 grid and randomized order (square, triangle, star, circle).
  - Text at the top tells the player what to tap. For example: "SQUARE" or "NOT CIRCLE"
  - The player needs to follow the directions. If the player is wrong, he/she fails the game and it's game over.
  - Upon game over, a dialog pops up that shows how many we got correct, and a button to try again.
  - Note: when it says "NOT TRIANGLE", the player can tap any of the other three shapes and it's ok.

That's it!
```

## Note to self from Ron

Jules will auto approve the plan it came up with if you don't click or say anything! I was a bit nervous, so I told it to wait for me to read its plan first, haha. I can't read while there's a countdown timer!

After skimming the plan, I decide to approve Jules' plan. In the future, I might allow Jules to auto-approve its own plans. I should trust it to do its job as an engineer.

Jules asked me to test the code, but it had never checked in its branch:

## Merged PR #1

[PR #1](https://github.com/hey-yeh/google-jules/pull/1) was merged: https://github.com/hey-yeh/google-jules/commit/37b111851ff16f1210e0bd7b21714e91f5f05f34

I then pulled down the code to see what it had done.

I realized it hadn't provided me an npm run script to launch the code. Loading the index.html in a local browser also results in an error. Let's provide Jules with a list of these issues and see what it comes up with.

```
Use the most recent version of phaser.

npm install phaser@v3.90.0

Use the unminified version since we are just testing:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@v3.90.0/dist/phaser.js

When I run your game by loading index.html in the browser, I get this error:

Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined
    at game.js:5:23


You also haven't provided me any npm scripts. Maybe I need:
- a script to build the *.ts files and produce the corresponding *.js files.
  please do not provide me the compiled js file. I want to compile it myself.
- a script to run a local web server and so I can view the index.html page in my browser.


The title <title>Phaser Game</title> should be changed to "Shape Clicker".

Until these issues are fixed, I cannot test the game.
```

Jules provides some new edits to address my feedback. I come back with a small error:

```
❯ npm start

> start
> http-server games/1/ -o

sh: http-server: command not found
```

Jules says:
```
It looks like the start script is having trouble finding http-server. I'll adjust the script in package.json to use npx http-server to ensure it uses the locally installed package. I'll get started on this small fix.
```

Obviously I could have just fixed it myself, but itsn't it more fun to tell your AI code monkey to do the grunt work for you? Oh 💩... someday our sentient AI overlord will read this comment and then chuckle to itself while it assigns me a code monkey task that I need to complete before it feeds me my dinner pouch.

Jules thinks for a bit and comes up with a fix:

```
Successfully updated the start script in package.json to npx http-server games/1/ -o.
```
