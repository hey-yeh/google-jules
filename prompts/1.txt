# Prompt 1 at Saturday, May 24, 2025 - 3:02â€¯PM:

Let's make a game with Phaser.io and Typescript.

All our games will be stored in the games/ folder, which doesn't yet exist. The first game will be game #1, which will be stored in games/1/

Let's start with a simple wrapper for a simple hello world Phaser project:
* games/1/ contains index.html
* games/1/ contains game.ts which is compiled to game.js. For simplicity, let's keep the built JS files alongside the TS files. This is a super simple game.
* index.html
  - Responsive webpage that works for iOS/Android and also desktop web.
  - The phaser game will take up 100% width and 100% height of the page. 
  - The page background is #222222.
* game.ts
  - This game is simple. It presents four shapes on screen in a 2 x 2 grid and randomized order (square, triangle, star, circle).
  - Text at the top tells the player what to tap. For example: "SQUARE" or "NOT CIRCLE"
  - The player needs to follow the directions. If the player is wrong, he/she fails the game and it's game over.
  - Upon game over, a dialog pops up that shows how many we got correct, and a button to try again.
  - Note: when it says "NOT TRIANGLE", the player can tap any of the other three shapes and it's ok.

That's it!

# Note to self from Ron

Interestingly, Jules will auto approve the plan it came up with if you don't click or say anything! I was a bit nervous, so I told it to wait for me to read its plan first, haha. I can't read while there's a countdown timer!

After reading, I decide to approve Jules' plan. In the future, I might allow Jules to auto-approve its own plans. I should trust it to do its job as an engineer.
