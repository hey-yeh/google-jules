# Overview
The goal is to learn how to use Google Jules to build a simple game with the Phaser game toolkit: https://phaser.io/

This README is written by a human (Ron B. Yeh). The prompts in the `prompts/` folder are written by Ron as well.

Everything else will be written by Jules. All I do is write prompts and then evaluate the output and merge the PRs. All my work will be done in English. Jules will write the Typescript.

Whenever I need media assets like sounds or images, I will look for AI assistants that can generate these for me. Ideally, I won't have to edit images in Photoshop. But who knows... if I have to step in, I will write a comment below on what I did as a human.



## Things I Did as a Human
* Create this repo https://github.com/hey-yeh/google-jules/ and create a `prompts/` folder and write this README.
* Sign in to jules.google.com and authorize this repo.
